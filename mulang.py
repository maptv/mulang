# ## 1 Quarto
#
# Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
# finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.
#
# ## 2 Running Code
#
# Quarto files using the jupyter engine cannot mix languages. 1. Create
# one Quarto file for each language and one `main.qmd`: - `main.qmd` -
# does not have any code chunks, only prose and embed shortcodes - has the
# engine option set to knitr in its YAML header - the other Quarto files -
# do not have any prose, only code - have the YAML header engine option
# set to jupyter and the relevant language 2. Create Jupyter notebooks
# from the Quarto files 3. Keep them all in sync with one of the following
# options a. Convert the Quarto files into Jupyter notebooks and work in
# the notebooks b. Output the Quarto files to Jupyter notebooks 3. Embed
# cells from the Jupyter notebooks in `main.qmd` 4. Generate all output
# files from `main.qmd`
#
# 1.  Set the engine option to knitr in the main Quarto file YAML header
# 2.  Use Python, R, and bash code in their respective chunks
# 3.  Eventually move code into scripts and Jupyter notebooks to keep the
#     quarto file small
#
# <!-- -->
#
# 1.  Julia code must be in Jupyter notebooks
# 2.  Embed cells from the Jupyter notebooks in the Quarto file
# 3.  Bring in scripts with the file chunk option Keep Python, R, and
#     Julia code in separate scripts
#
# <!-- -->
#
# 1.  Keep Python, R, and Julia code in separate scripts
# 2.  Use Quarto notebooks that are syncâ€™ed to Jupyter Notebooks with the
#     correct kernel setting.
# 3.  Embed cells from those notebooks in a combined Quarto notebook Use
#     Jupyter for

# pairs(ma, col = rainbow(3)[iris$Species])

# ggpairs(iris,                 # Data frame
#         columns = 1:4,        # Columns
#         aes(color = Species,  # Color by group (cat. variable)
#             alpha = 0.5))     # Transparency 
# ```

# Will this be deleted?
